"The Chaos of the Normal"
IKKAH SPEAKS OF HIMSELF:
I would counsel closed ears, for those who contain the great Ideas, have no opinions.
Who doth know what his own subconsciousness contains? Still less his own Arcana.They are the great who allow its operation by silence.
Of two things we have choice: degeneration or immobility.
Out of the past cometh this new thing.
Becoming heaven's slaves-is some of pleasure begged again?
Man strives for increase,-the monstrous world of vague and mad Ideas is incarnating.
Come back, your goal is jail! Turn about and you arrive .....
This maddest of worlds. Daily is pleasure limited by the necessity of cheapenedfacilities.
Onwards and ever more weary-till sleep-then backwards.
There is nothing conceivable that does not exist, because the vision is feeble.
In keeping the right distance from Things, is Safety. But how much should we gain?
Experience is ignorance. The necessity of reoccurrence.
One thing is certain: we are subject to our own moral laws, whether we are or are notaware of them.
The desire determines, and no later belief shall alter it one whit.
The highest creations are those that harmonize the most incongruous things.
Art is the truth we have realized or our belief.
The great human factor in Life is deceit: Always the greater deceiver-self?
The wrath is revealed against all that hold the truth in righteousness.
Still are those shallownesses, who could know they hide a universe?
And tell me, what is it the obvious does not contain?
Know much of life! Should death give you its secret?
Self suggestion-to will, this is the great teacher: not dogma.
To those of fixed Ideas, beware of suppressed evacuation.
What the world reveres most, treat with the utmost contempt.
Consumption, evacuation, sleep: this labour suffers of no variation for to-morrow weagain procreate life.
O, fool! suicide does not exist . . . there is no death.
Death is change and for many very small change.
You who stink like a butcher's shambles-what is your daily menu?
Become less carnivorous. If the food is wholesome, the body shall not suffer.
The difference between man and beast is one of acquisition, not digestion.
There is no lasting peace-ye eternally fall in love with the new thing of belief.
To the mental gymnast: your somersault returns from the place where it began.
Slave! All you know for certain-you suffer.
Embrace reality by imagination.
From birth is a degeneration of function-safe is he who never leaves his mother's womb.
What is perfect does not reflect its caricature. What is true has no argument-in that it isvoliton.
The workers of malignity own the Kingdom of Earth.
What asses these teachers, prophets and moralists now appear! And through themwhat greater she-asses we have become!
You would have prophecy? First tell me your sleeping partner's name . . . . .
What once evoked a mighty passion-is now repulsive; lest ye forget: sleep alone.
If you yourself cannot be ungodly-then nothing will convert you.
No nearer th goal for life is eternal.
Which are more unclean: they who make a profesion of their morality, or they whoprostitute?
Life is a viscous charity from which germinates friendships towards parasites.
The necessity of a better life is intoxication but more and greater things than strongdrink intoxicate.
Thou hast become remote-I rejoice in thee!
Who invented such things as vanity and humiliation?
The higher the form of creation the more it habitates earth and the more it is consciousof body.
Everything that is half realized becomes the material of dreams; man has always badlymixed the dream with the reality.
He who transcends time escapes necessity.
The living Lord speaks: 'In disciples is my satisfaction.' A weary one asked: 'Is it notwritten on the sandals of the prostitute-follow me?'
All undesirable things become morally fearsome.
Only the animal in man dances . . .
Hatred is life-the love of possession.
He who can truthfully say-I believe in nothing but myself-in all things realized.
ZOD-KA SPEAKS OF IKKAH
The abyss Self projecting from non-existence the procreatrix I, was the great changeand the beginning: to extend the purpose of desire-for Time to make all existenceinexact-those things kept ever vague.
Thus was the will to operate unbegotten.
One thing is nominally, everything alternatingly desirous. That which is first desired ispermitted, then externalized and taken away by a circumlocution of beliefs becominglaw.
No knowledge would seperate us from the virtues of non-existence but that for man-having become involved with disease, all his food is poisonous; his complete saturationis inevitable that he may become again healthy. Thus man wills by thought.
By the 'death posture' (A simulation of death by the utter negation of thought, i.e. theprevention of desire from belief and the functioning of all consciousness through thesexuality) [not for subjection of mind, body or longevity nor any thing as such] the Bodyis allowed to manifest spontaneously and is arbitrary and impervious to reaction. Onlyhe who is unconscious of his actions has courage beyond good and evil: and is pure inthis wisdom of sound sleep.
Will to pleasure is the basic function underlying all activity whether conscious or not,-and whatsoever the means.
Denial of this Self-love is disease-the cause of homicide; the sufferings of part-sexualities and small things germinating.
Knowledge of necessities is desirous:-Deliberation is but a sorry disatisfaction-a firstcause of illusions, harnessing man to a mass of half-realized desires. Remember! OIkkah, these present Ideas of consciousness obtaining in senses and bodies, aretransitory-are destined for usage and other predeterminations-and unnecessary towakefulness. Will is transition; the painful process of transmigration-the labour of birthof death. Volition to supersede a thing is inability to realize the living Self. For whateveris attained is but the re-awaking of an earlier experience of body.
Man should most desire a simultaneous consciousness of his separate entities. Allconsciousness of 'I' is a decline and vegetates good and evil afresh-the compulsion oflimit and morality. From spontaneous nonexistence, germinate all significant ecstasy-that shall last in the uttermost impossibilities unconditioned to will.
Alas! what ornaments are grave-yards? The pleasure ground of self is contact with theliving.
The fool hastens to man with a mouth overfull of new discoveries of power subservientto will! What matters it that we have realized a little more of I? Of beyond its limits ofpossibility?
Note well! All things are possible even in nightmares-becoming, they are a necessity, anadditional boundary to memory-the further seperate entities of consciousness.
Remember O Ikkah! Thou shall not cease to be again what is denied-unto the end ofconception: thus man has constructed his seed. These sentient creatures and thebeyond conceptions in the order of evolution were thou once as they?
O Ikkah, Thou art this present God-this termite and many other things not yetdomesticated or associated with thought.
This focus 'I' called consciousness is unaware of its entire living embodiments butalternates and epitomizes their personalities.
What is 'I' and the extent of its conscious habitation?
. . . A weak desire, a memory governed by ethics and ignorant of its own bodies.Therefore that which is indeliberate is the more vital and is will: discarded knowledge isthe sexuality and becomes law.
Thus entity exists in many units simultaneously without consciousness of 'Ego' as oneflesh. Verily, I say-the deliberations of many exist in living animations-theirconsciousness split among a multitude of creatures but knowing only the moreimportant [?] incarnations-What greater misery than this?
Of others, their awake-consciousness is aware of more than one entity and obtainecstasy by saturable desire.
O Ikkah! Jest viciously! Abandon this haunted mortuary in a blind turning-by significantcourage.
The 'I' surfeit-swelled is the end of compassion-the indrawing of sex to Self-love.Fortunate is he who absorbs his female bodies-ever projecting-for he acquires theextent of his body.
Whatever is desired, predetermines its existence in endless ramifications miserably andevanescent: Self-love is the paradox of I.
Oh Ikkah Zod-ka! Thy fiction of finality has prevented sleep and created eternity. O,invent sound sleep by the utter ruin of cosmos!
For impalpably and anterior to consciousness-all things exist....
With sensibility and name, becoming its living simulation and thus it disappears-involvingits consequent necessity.
Reason has become too sensible, thus desire has become legerdemain mixed withdiablerie. The soul, proud and blighted . . . is a civil war of desire: thereof the necessityfor medicine and anesthesia. Man has made this environment: the mind is now the bellyof the sexuality. Thus I suggest to thee- Self-love and its own temptation to excess.
Verily, greater courage hath none than to satisfy the unexpected desire by Self-pleasure.
For this reason, that when the desire again reacts, to operate in the ego, the sufferingshall be ecstatic. How do I know? Not by farcical dialogue with Self but through contactwith its undulations . . . are we not ever standing on our own volcano?
What is beyond man-something more dishonest or a further beast?
One thing is desired, another is thought; and a different becomes.
Everything loved obtains an obscene disease. These dream postures are ominousprophecy of thyself to become-the obscure wish. O joy and woe! which is the highermorality-to love man while being man or to reincarnate as woman to fulfil desire? Deathis that degeneration, an alternation of ego in consciousness [i.e., desire], itsmetamorphosis into separate entities for that purpose: serving its own. Man's livingvirtues are those unfamiliar with names. His absurd I is ever supralapsarian. Man hasexhausted his courage by imaginations engendered from the damned: Never can hesatisfy what follows these repressions.
Thou who tremblest all over! Thy soul shudders! Thou dost perish from the poison ofyesterday's armour and righteousness! O incomprehensible synonymy! O thou who artneither the vigorous kiss of my twin sexes nor its writhings of hatred and black shame.Nothing is discovered of thee until I invented it: from the ceaseless resurrection ofearlier deliberations. O thou syzygy of my I and Self! Thou becomest volatile towhatsoever is sensed. Art thou the hidden wish for madness and hysteric love? O thou"untamed" within, thou shall not lose virtue-for thee I will not domesticate whilegenerating. O idiocy! where is that path where I may wander naked in frenzy, atrespasser against all things reasonable? O time! saith good and evil: 'Come, come! Ego,I come!'
. . . . . . .
Knowledge alone is transitory, the illusion subsequent to 'I desire all things.'
Eternal, without beginning is Self; without end am I; there is no other power andsubstance. The ever changing modifications and diversities we see are the results offorgetfulness, misinterpretated by nightmare senses. When the Self again desires, then Ionly and nothing else shall remain. Permitting all things, whatsoever is imagined comesout of it. Believe what you will, it has no compassion. The connotation Self-love isapplicable to all things. To it, all things are equal. The destroyer of devotees; lover of allthings unique.
Giving overflow to all who are indifferent to wanglers, who jest at doctrines . . . ofemancipation in celibacy and vituperation. I declare this Self-pleasure alone is free of Theism; the disenthralment of God and the distractions of ego in the many entities ofexistence I show.
Ye who praise Truth thereby causing its necessity are compelled to live differently. Outof this afterthought of belief-thrives this somnambulating generation of unpleasuredfools, liars and homicides-ever bewildered by good and evil. All has become inborn sex,so complex 'am I,' that a successful awakening is impossible without catastrophe. Birthis now painful, life a dire necessity and death an uncertainty-except of fearsome things.What further, O Ikkah, should a cesspool of truths contain? Nor truth, nor women, noranything else once made objective shall satisfy. They who are committed to doctrinesshall continue to move in this cycle of transmigrating belief: degenerating beyond limitsthey dare not face, and so allow conception to exist of itself from the imaginations 'Ibelieve.'

What more disgusting? For I am all sex. What I am not is moral thought, simulating andseparating. Imagined through forgetfulness, born asleep, whose very essence is vague,how can this world with such vapid antecedents, be anything but unthinkable! What manprohibits and then commits will certainly cause suffering, because he has willed double.Born of complex desire, results of actions are dual: multitudinous virtue and vice.Creation is causee through this formula of reaction and is a servile believing-all thisuniverse has come out of it. When by that unprohibiting Self-love all this cosmos iscertainly familiar and pleasured, it should be practised with labour.
But who is honest enough to believe this without relapse? Having renounced both goodand evil conveniently, one should engage in spasmodic madness. Renouncing everythingelse take shelter in that Self-love, which incites the functions into the bold, 'freedomfrom necessity am I': virtue and vice shall cease. Self-illumination am I; the procreatrix ofthis universe. Indomitable in body: born of the bastard truth I made. When the eyes areshut the world certainly does not exist. O chaos! is there no greater joy than flagellation;the ecstatic paralysis that makes holocausts of withered souls; the hideously pitiablecripples-"I fear . . . "? I assert this Self-love to be a most secret ritual hidden byblasphemous Ideographs: and he who calls, pronouncing the word fearlessly, the entirecreation of women shall rush into him.

What are lies-but mistimed events?
What is time but a variety of one thing?
What is all folly, but will?
What are all beliefs but the possibilities of I?
What is all future but resurrection?
What is all creation but thyself?
Why is all existence? Awake! Up! up, for thine own sake-
Self-love discover.
O sin, where is thy violence?
O love, where is thine incest?
O thought, where is thy courage?
O hope, where is thy faith?
O Self where is thy humility?
O truth, where is thy mispronunciation?
Verily, Self-love alone is complete!
THE SEXUALITY AND SLEEP OF AAOS
Aaos having realized at an early age that all systems of belief, religion and rituals;consisted alone in their original value to their creators; And were of the weary, toincarnate pleasure by hope, control by fear; and to Deify by morals; That cowards fear,and must needs promise pleasure of their sufferings; And they who had experienced "I,"would have you destroy its body; and potential: Verily, Aaos realized that the origin of I,was for pleasurable procreation . . . but that things had been changed.
Aaos then pondered in his heart long over the geometry of the world of senses; andspake thus: "How far short has realization fallen from original conception? Have we notlived all things previous to the event? What is any desire but all desire? but men getmarried and nothing is sufficiently arbitrary.
I am the origin of all creation, certain it is that I want not salvation,
[observing all the miserably diseased mob:]
"O, grant that I may add to the world a far greater suffering!"
God is a precocious creation of the Apes, something that must be suppressed: Manmust regain his sexuality.
What is man-this feeder on dead bodies of Self? . . . A mole, a carnivorous plant, adisease of himself, a conglomeration of-"it was" and a cause, effecting the miscarriageof his desires-ever creating his future necessities:
What man knoweth the perturbations of his own fear?
Verily, suffering is its own reward.
He who willed, knoweth not his own offspring.
Man projects a vague 'Self' and calls it truth and many other qualified names: Verily,once a Thing is named it becomes nothingness to its meaning.
All happiness is an illusion and a sorry snare. All righteousness is a dishonesty and allsin a pleasure. Assuredly, the courageous alone seem safe . . . without remorse.
Man invented Self-pleasure but knoweth not his own love.
Everything was once arbitrary. Yet they who spoke: their power has ended in commonsexual practice-abnormal only with jaded appetites. They who knew were rightlycrucified, scorned, ignored and their mouths sealed with their own excrement.
Have we not forgotten more than we shall ever learn?
Where is the magic to revitalize the mouldering words?
Everything is again eventually arbitrary!
What is there to believe that is free of belief? What is there to will that is safe fromreaction?
Why is belief always incarnating? Though oft times not even a sincere wish? Whoamong men knoweth what he believes? Everything is true at some time.
What is this unpleasant Thing, necessity-suffering? How originated pain? What isnecessity-but conditioned belief?
What is it we eternally desire and say, through disease?
Verily, directly a man speaketh-he suffers.
What is Self and I? And all these myriad forms called creation-all so essentially like me?Who can realize this Self-portraiture of all Things?
Verily, the sexuality has no limit in conception.
Whither I would go, there had I long been before.
Eternal re-occurence would seem necessary to greater multiplicity!
For what reason this loss of memory by these bewilding refractions of my originalimage,-that I once made-and out of which spring the sexes?
God is born again of desire, call it by whatever name: this unmanifested memory has noname till belief incarnates. Hence it may be called,-the re-occuring sub-division of 'I'.Everything becomes necessary.
Man is subject to his own law: All else is an obscene jest and a lie.
Thus reasoned Aaos in his youth and went to sleep alone.
After a vilely repulsive nightmare Aaos awoke saying:
"Quiescent are my depths, who could realize They contain such criminal abortions of thecosmos?"
What is all body but materialized desire? What are dreams but unsatisfied desiresstriving to foretell their possibility in despite of morals?
Life is but will, that has become organic after satiety; its further desires striving forUnity. Death is that further will incarnating in body.
The next day Aaos spoke unto his growing beard:
"Destroy O, my Self, these hallucinations of I am not by knowledge of pleasure."
Thou mighty ecstasy that willeth Thy pleasure in suffering!
Make my consciousness reality of thee in body!
What is Self but Cosmos? What is I but Chaos? Eternally creating its pleasure,everything could become arbitrary.
Whatever deceit we practice, the functions of the emotions are one; their expressiondual: Time making multitudinous by denial.
What is experience, but denial? What is the centre, but belief?
After a long suspiration, Aaos spoke aloud to his 'I':
"Awake, my Self-love! Leave this hour of cow-dust, I am all things to pleasure. Too longhave I lived the nightmares of others in my sleep . . . Arise! get forth and feed from themighty udder of Life. Thou art not a cow-herd, nor grass, neither cows no kine! Butonce again, a creator of cows-who loves their breasts! Are not all things cows to thypleasure-whether they would or not? And what is Cow? Is it not a fountain? Didst thounot create God, teach nature all secrets and crowd the spaces with cows of desire,unknown and manifesting? Didst thou not create and destroy Woman?"
Again Aaos spoke, but unto his lidless eye:
"Behold thou hoary, white headed, thou silent watcher of night and day: thou death-clutch on the smallnesses of Time! This neither-neither I, shall transvalue ennui, fear, andall diseases to my wish. Dead is my misery in suffering! How could it exist in my Zodiac,unwilled? I, who transcend ecstasy by ecstasy meditating Need not be in Self-love!Verily, this constant ecstasy I indraw from Self-creation. By castrating 'of,' my belief isbalanced: my arbitrary automatism serving its diverse self-pleasure."
Then Aaos meditated and murmured: "All things exist by me: all men exist in me, yetwho doth not turn away from his own superabundance while realizing? All desire is for unity: thus my vision seeth through mine ears. Let my unity be realized sufficiently, thusshall my sexuality be convenient unto itself and escape the conceivable . . . Where is lustwhen the tests wither? Verily these senses have a further pupose beyond their own:thus shall thou steal the fire from Heaven. All things return to their earliest functions."
At that moment Aaos realized he was not alone; and a voice asked:
"Hast thou no fear?"
Laughing aloud, Aaos answered:
"Hidden from thy small susceptibilities, monstrous enormities are commited! On the daymy wind bloweth a little the cow-dust away-thou O fool, shalt vomit hot blood at thineown prostitution and incest. When thou knowest not, the lust wills non-rationally, thebelief bindeth with modest Ideas; the body is subject and suffers. What man canprevent his belief from incarnating? Who is free of filth and disease? All men are servileto the great unconsciousness of thier purpose in desire. The I thinks, the Self doth.There is no salvation from desire, neither day nor night does it cease its lengthyprocreation of cause and effect: penetrating all things inexplicably. Endless are itselements and nothing whatsoever escapes its embrace-but its own Self-love. . . . ShouldI fear my I?"
Aaos lowering his voice, uttered:
"What further use shall I give my sexuality? Verily it is alway speaking for me! This I, non-resisting to the Self, becomes irresistible."
When the voice had left Aaos went his way muttering and smiling:
"Can it be possible that dead wives resurrect?"
For he thought that-Woman was dead. With this reflection Aaoss became silent.Awaking from his Self-introspection he spake aloud to his body:
"Man is something that has resurrected from an archetype, a previous desire gone toworms. All conceptions predetermine their degeneration or supersedure by degrees ofmorality. Verily a new sexuality shall be mine,-unecessary to degenerate or surpass. Togive it a name, I call it the Unmodified sexuality; without a name it shall be conscious ofall desire: thus no ecstasy shall escape me. Its wisdom shall be dreams of Self-lovevibrating all the manifestations-I am he, who self pleasures non-morally."

They who are committed to doctrinesshall continue to move in this cycle of transmigrating belief: degenerating beyond limitsthey dare not face, and so allow conception to exist of itself from the imaginations 'Ibelieve.'

What more disgusting? For I am all sex. What I am not is moral thought, simulating andseparating. Imagined through forgetfulness, born asleep, whose very essence is vague,how can this world with such vapid antecedents, be anything but unthinkable! What manprohibits and then commits will certainly cause suffering, because he has willed double.Born of complex desire, results of actions are dual: multitudinous virtue and vice.Creation is causee through this formula of reaction and is a servile believing-all thisuniverse has come out of it. When by that unprohibiting Self-love all this cosmos iscertainly familiar and pleasured, it should be practised with labour.
But who is honest enough to believe this without relapse? Having renounced both goodand evil conveniently, one should engage in spasmodic madness. Renouncing everythingelse take shelter in that Self-love, which incites the functions into the bold, 'freedomfrom necessity am I': virtue and vice shall cease. Self-illumination am I; the procreatrix ofthis universe. Indomitable in body: born of the bastard truth I made. When the eyes areshut the world certainly does not exist. O chaos! is there no greater joy than flagellation;the ecstatic paralysis that makes holocausts of withered souls; the hideously pitiablecripples-"I fear . . . "? I assert this Self-love to be a most secret ritual hidden byblasphemous Ideographs: and he who calls, pronouncing the word fearlessly, the entirecreation of women shall rush into him.

What are lies-but mistimed events?
What is time but a variety of one thing?
What is all folly, but will?
What are all beliefs but the possibilities of I?
What is all future but resurrection?
What is all creation but thyself?
Why is all existence? Awake! Up! up, for thine own sake-
Self-love discover.
O sin, where is thy violence?
O love, where is thine incest?
O thought, where is thy courage?
O hope, where is thy faith?
O Self where is thy humility?
O truth, where is thy mispronunciation?
Verily, Self-love alone is complete!
THE SEXUALITY AND SLEEP OF AAOS
Aaos having realized at an early age that all systems of belief, religion and rituals;consisted alone in their original value to their creators; And were of the weary, toincarnate pleasure by hope, control by fear; and to Deify by morals; That cowards fear,and must needs promise pleasure of their sufferings; And they who had experienced "I,"would have you destroy its body; and potential: Verily, Aaos realized that the origin of I,was for pleasurable procreation . . . but that things had been changed.
Aaos then pondered in his heart long over the geometry of the world of senses; andspake thus: "How far short has realization fallen from original conception? Have we notlived all things previous to the event? What is any desire but all desire? but men getmarried and nothing is sufficiently arbitrary.
I am the origin of all creation, certain it is that I want not salvation,
[observing all the miserably diseased mob:]
"O, grant that I may add to the world a far greater suffering!"
God is a precocious creation of the Apes, something that must be suppressed: Manmust regain his sexuality.
What is man-this feeder on dead bodies of Self? . . . A mole, a carnivorous plant, adisease of himself, a conglomeration of-"it was" and a cause, effecting the miscarriageof his desires-ever creating his future necessities:
What man knoweth the perturbations of his own fear?
Verily, suffering is its own reward.
He who willed, knoweth not his own offspring.
Man projects a vague 'Self' and calls it truth and many other qualified names: Verily,once a Thing is named it becomes nothingness to its meaning.
All happiness is an illusion and a sorry snare. All righteousness is a dishonesty and allsin a pleasure. Assuredly, the courageous alone seem safe . . . without remorse.
Man invented Self-pleasure but knoweth not his own love.
Everything was once arbitrary. Yet they who spoke: their power has ended in commonsexual practice-abnormal only with jaded appetites. They who knew were rightlycrucified, scorned, ignored and their mouths sealed with their own excrement.
Have we not forgotten more than we shall ever learn?
Where is the magic to revitalize the mouldering words?
Everything is again eventually arbitrary!
What is there to believe that is free of belief? What is there to will that is safe fromreaction?
Why is belief always incarnating? Though oft times not even a sincere wish? Whoamong men knoweth what he believes? Everything is true at some time.
What is this unpleasant Thing, necessity-suffering? How originated pain? What isnecessity-but conditioned belief?
What is it we eternally desire and say, through disease?
Verily, directly a man speaketh-he suffers.
What is Self and I? And all these myriad forms called creation-all so essentially like me?Who can realize this Self-portraiture of all Things?
Verily, the sexuality has no limit in conception.
Whither I would go, there had I long been before.
Eternal re-occurence would seem necessary to greater multiplicity!
For what reason this loss of memory by these bewilding refractions of my originalimage,-that I once made-and out of which spring the sexes?
God is born again of desire, call it by whatever name: this unmanifested memory has noname till belief incarnates. Hence it may be called,-the re-occuring sub-division of 'I'.Everything becomes necessary.
Man is subject to his own law: All else is an obscene jest and a lie.
Thus reasoned Aaos in his youth and went to sleep alone.
After a vilely repulsive nightmare Aaos awoke saying:
"Quiescent are my depths, who could realize They contain such criminal abortions of thecosmos?"
What is all body but materialized desire? What are dreams but unsatisfied desiresstriving to foretell their possibility in despite of morals?
Life is but will, that has become organic after satiety; its further desires striving forUnity. Death is that further will incarnating in body.
The next day Aaos spoke unto his growing beard:
"Destroy O, my Self, these hallucinations of I am not by knowledge of pleasure."
Thou mighty ecstasy that willeth Thy pleasure in suffering!
Make my consciousness reality of thee in body!
What is Self but Cosmos? What is I but Chaos? Eternally creating its pleasure,everything could become arbitrary.
Whatever deceit we practice, the functions of the emotions are one; their expressiondual: Time making multitudinous by denial.
What is experience, but denial? What is the centre, but belief?
After a long suspiration, Aaos spoke aloud to his 'I':
"Awake, my Self-love! Leave this hour of cow-dust, I am all things to pleasure. Too longhave I lived the nightmares of others in my sleep . . . Arise! get forth and feed from themighty udder of Life. Thou art not a cow-herd, nor grass, neither cows no kine! Butonce again, a creator of cows-who loves their breasts! Are not all things cows to thypleasure-whether they would or not? And what is Cow? Is it not a fountain? Didst thounot create God, teach nature all secrets and crowd the spaces with cows of desire,unknown and manifesting? Didst thou not create and destroy Woman?"
Again Aaos spoke, but unto his lidless eye:
"Behold thou hoary, white headed, thou silent watcher of night and day: thou death-clutch on the smallnesses of Time! This neither-neither I, shall transvalue ennui, fear, andall diseases to my wish. Dead is my misery in suffering! How could it exist in my Zodiac,unwilled? I, who transcend ecstasy by ecstasy meditating Need not be in Self-love!Verily, this constant ecstasy I indraw from Self-creation. By castrating 'of,' my belief isbalanced: my arbitrary automatism serving its diverse self-pleasure."
Then Aaos meditated and murmured: "All things exist by me: all men exist in me, yetwho doth not turn away from his own superabundance while realizing? All desire is for unity: thus my vision seeth through mine ears. Let my unity be realized sufficiently, thusshall my sexuality be convenient unto itself and escape the conceivable . . . Where is lustwhen the tests wither? Verily these senses have a further pupose beyond their own:thus shall thou steal the fire from Heaven. All things return to their earliest functions."
At that moment Aaos realized he was not alone; and a voice asked:
"Hast thou no fear?"
Laughing aloud, Aaos answered:
"Hidden from thy small susceptibilities, monstrous enormities are commited! On the daymy wind bloweth a little the cow-dust away-thou O fool, shalt vomit hot blood at thineown prostitution and incest. When thou knowest not, the lust wills non-rationally, thebelief bindeth with modest Ideas; the body is subject and suffers. What man canprevent his belief from incarnating? Who is free of filth and disease? All men are servileto the great unconsciousness of thier purpose in desire. The I thinks, the Self doth.There is no salvation from desire, neither day nor night does it cease its lengthyprocreation of cause and effect: penetrating all things inexplicably. Endless are itselements and nothing whatsoever escapes its embrace-but its own Self-love. . . . ShouldI fear my I?"
Aaos lowering his voice, uttered:
"What further use shall I give my sexuality? Verily it is alway speaking for me! This I, non-resisting to the Self, becomes irresistible."
When the voice had left Aaos went his way muttering and smiling:
"Can it be possible that dead wives resurrect?"
For he thought that-Woman was dead. With this reflection Aaoss became silent.Awaking from his Self-introspection he spake aloud to his body:
"Man is something that has resurrected from an archetype, a previous desire gone toworms. All conceptions predetermine their degeneration or supersedure by degrees ofmorality. Verily a new sexuality shall be mine,-unecessary to degenerate or surpass. Togive it a name, I call it the Unmodified sexuality; without a name it shall be conscious ofall desire: thus no ecstasy shall escape me. Its wisdom shall be dreams of Self-lovevibrating all the manifestations-I am he, who self pleasures non-morally."
