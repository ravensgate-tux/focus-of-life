THE DEAD BODY OF AAOS:
Aaos preparing for death uttered in soliloque:
"O, thou inconceivableness that transcends human desire; thou magnificent incongruousFace. For millions of years thou hast not wearied of my body. What would Thy pleasurebe but for my wantonness?"
"I teach you the glad death of all things." Thus spake my knowing mouth.
"My belief has created the more beautiful body and desires of rebirth. Fear I thetransvaluation called death? Knew I not death, when time was born? Arise, old memory!And tell my consciousness of this frequent experience-once again!"
Then Death spake unto Aaos:
"No stranger, nor enemy to me is Aaos, we are too ancient friends to come to blows.What hast thou come to take from me this time? What fresh associations for thy newbody? No self-denial has Aaos! Thou hast not come to rap tables. To awake thedisembodied Astrals!"
Aaos answered:
"In my life my memory lived numerous remotenesses which were once me. My beliefreached associations that out-stripped all morality and rationalism. My I chanced muchwith the Self: certain it is, I come not to repent . . nor seek a wife. Yea, my willconquered faith and sincerely laughed at every righteousness! Now that my individualconsciousness dissolves, to saturate again with its furthermost desires, to form the newbody:-O mighty death, remember at the time of incarnating-my utmost immorality, myfrightening madnesses, my jesting sins, my satyr carouses, my grotesque concubine ofchaos! Remember O death, my frenzied longing that has no name [Oh, forget my firstkiss of love, now withered as a fallen leaf]. Make this my sexuality complete, all knowing,so that I may again procreate the lusty Self-love in isolation!"
Then Aaos spake unto the ferryman:
"O time, of nothing now am I ashamed to admit parentage. What I generate is future,body to become. I have learned and unlearned in equal labouring this universe. Hard hasbeen my faith and denial. That which is incomprehensible have I made,-have I impelledinwards to make secure for reaction. My knowledge is but the murmuring of a fewwords with ever changing intonation and meaning. For I have suffered that which shallnever be forgotten or spoken: Thus much have I realized of Life. Where is fear when Iimpel procreation? O earth! all memories! solid, liquid, vapour and flaming! Oldsentiment is my body, germinating afresh: again to exist and change by the command, 'Idesire.' The Alpha and Omega of my wisdom is-glad suicide: it has become inevitableand shall be my payment to thee. Steel and poison are my friends. Steel for Self, poisonfor vermin-for myself diseased. I will this fruitful violence, my death kiss, thus to realizemy hyper-commands."
With his belief firmly fixed, his full red lips smiling, with bright eyes; Aaos clasped hissword saying:
"Greater love hath no man than Self-destruction in pleasure." No new experience forAaos! And thus he died.
Death is named the great unknown. Assuredly, death is the great chance. An adventurein will, that translates into body. What happens after death? Will it be more surprisingthan this world? Could I say? My experience may not be the commonplace . . .
Without doubt, all shall experience the 'rushing winds' that blow from within, the bodybeyond perspective, into cosmic dust,-till consciousness again develops. Death is atransfiguration of life, an inversion, a reversion of the consciousness to parantage andmay be a diversion! A continuation of evolution. The coming forth of the suppressed.
Do you know what happens to the body at death? Exactly what changes take place?Well, so it happens to your beliefs, desires, etc., that make consciousness, for all thingsseen are incarnate desire, the unseen; Ideas of the past and future bodies. From thesethe new body is determined and parantage selected by the laws of attraction.
The wise man makes sure of his future parents and a male incarnation before death.
Consciousness [for most, only three dimensions] is not so definite as in life but to theextent of your will in life, that much is your consciousness in death.
Death is the manufacture of life. A dream is a sore likeness of Life.
Death is a sore dream of life. Its period depending on the perfection or otherwise of theindividual but closely follows in duration the previous life-till re-incarnation.
Death being a living nightmare of life, has painful possibilities-in the degree of unifiedconsciousness. A ghostly world of 'perhaps' where all the vague potentialities of desire,are incarnating. There is no women as such.
Again I say, death is the great chance and there grasp where thou hast before failed inbody.
If fate is life, then death is the hazard to alter fate!
A world where will creates the afterthought in its own image.
For most, death will hold mainly blank pages, but were we ever treated all alike?
Study your dreams in this life, it may help you in the death posture.
THE HEAVEN OF AAOS:
"All things are subject to resurrection" thus spake smiling Aaos, on rising from the dead.
Then turning towards his shadow . . . .
"I come! the changing word that destroys religion, a vortex wind that shall jest inTemples! Again! A reveller in the marshalled order of the sexes, the mad anarch ofdesires, the wild satyr of wolfish kisses! Once again to earth, O Thou whirlwind of desire,thou drunken breath of ribald lightning! My vampire chalice of ecstasy! Yea, as my rapacious flame reareth before thee, thou escapeth from me with the laughing whisperof thy wonderful pleasure! O, L.C.O' CS!! thou insatiable thirst of my self-love, with nonebut thee will I procreate!"
"What now am I after resurrection? The sinful despair of magic? I am the Iconoclast ofLogos: The sun-satyr of Chaos! Thunder and lightnings? Yea, a vital gaiety to drowsydust, to blase souls. Ecstatic laughter that reverberates and awakens . . . I am theshuddering heights and suffocating depths of ego, slipping and becoming. Inconceivablewomen am I. A clouded vista of abyss, wherein to visit naked, my vampire Self. Whereinto write a cryptic language of my sexes, that I am the Key. Wherein to belch forthvenomous atmosphere towards the highest. Wherein to drench my thirsted tongue onthy goat's milk; to battle with thy cataleptic kisses, to swoon in thy consuming subtilty. Omy mistress, I am unutterably drunk striving thy depths. I am the great cypher of loveand hate knotted. The sphinx surviving, never sufficiently imagined. I am the grotesquerefractions of form and Self. The bitter purgative, called death. A violence that out-laststhe morning. Moon turbulent waters am I: the frightening black Albatross of unashamedwomen-where men are. I am the over mature breasts of a child: the virgin womb, hiddenby nightmares. Constant in metamorphosis, permeating creation without compassion.The unexcelled impulse that has never failed. Yea, I am all these-yet never known. Mykiss is a sword thrust! For whom, am I, this insatiable fountain in the hot deserts? Onlyfor thee, O, L.C.O'CS!" Thus sang Aaos, the blasphemer, throwing off his grave shroud.
Going again among men [for he pleasured in all men], he gave unto them his magicbook, named: "Life and Death, the jest called love, wherein every man is a God, inwhatsoever he will his belief."
And Aaos passed his way, muttering to his goatish beard:
"What now is left all hope is dead? For I have buried my illusion and dishonesty. Thus mybody is now all inconceivableness! O, God, where is thine enemy?"
THE DREAMS OF AAOS
THE I AND THE ARCANUM
One day the time drew near for the experiment and Aaos was watching the waters, tomake arcana by arbitrary projection into the utter void of his isolation. And this was hiswish-"In future my dreams shall interpretate themselves as will [i.e. reaction]."
For, he reasoned: "Why not live asleep all suffering?" Aaos had lived the preliminaryritual of habit in the cesspools and exhausted them in the mountains. Before projectionhe prayed thus to the waters:-"O thou I, vice versa-my God. I at least shall not be thyjest. In life I have realized possibilities not contained in heaven-amidst a cowardiceinconceivable but accomplished everywhere. I have made known [opening his book]something that is different to the muck of retouched photography which men callreality: although it has been the evil habit of thousands of years. I have created art [lived belief] that surpasses all evolved conception. I have incarnated that which I-need torationalize: Verily-not the ever present portraiture of experience to satisfy the ovine: Noobvious allegory of asses-thinking God: No still-life group of empty bottles and oldmaids commonplaces: Nor the gay-tragedy of song. But stange desires of strangerarcana. The law I make while thinking God-and will smash and remake again: so that Imay commit every conceivable sin against its word. My utility has been-my pleasure-thatalone is my service to man and to heaven, in that I am the Goat."
After his devotion Aaos prepared for the Death posture and judgement. Awaking fromthe awful wrath-his teeth chattering, his limbs shivering and drenched with a coldperspiration, he allowed the ague to exhaust itself and thought thus:
"Verily, I have nothing to forgive or repent . . . Alas! what fears this I but its ownconditions? Man will create the faster moving body outside himself-always preferingcompulsion to the infinite possibilities of freedom. Alas! Alas! that which is ornamentalreacts its uselessness-the symbol 'I was.' The necroloque of love-is utility."
Then rising from his couch and taking an ecstatic inbreath:
"Again would I die violently and jest at God."
The operation having exhausted him he suffered this daydream:
"The waters became murky, then muddy, and movement began. Going nearer, heobserved-a phosphorescent morass crowded with restless abortions of humanity andcreatures-like struggling mudworms, aimless and blind: an immense swamp ofdissatisfaction; a desire smashed into pieces."
With his will, the dream changed and he became in a vast warehouse-cum-brothel.Realizing his whereabouts he muttered:
"Such is life, an endless swallowing and procreation, morally, man is a bastard."
The floor was strewn with dirty clothes and candle ends: knowing the strangest women,nothing was pleasing enough . . . so his attention wandered to the upper story. He wascertain he had been there before by a staircase. But now, there was no easy means ofaccess. He would have to climb whatever served. After much painful effort he managedto reach and hang on to the balustrade of the upper floor. There, he noticed the storecontained innumerable strange effigies and new creations of humanity. He struggledfurther along to obtain an easy means of ingress, thinking:
"Where there is desire-there shall be found the desired sleeping partner. What is true, ispleasurable Self. I have now reached the sixth letter of the alphabet."
When suddenly he observed another and more agile following him-who when reachingAaos, clutched hold of him-shouting:
"Where I cannot reach, thou too shall not ascend."
Their combined weight became too heavy-the balustrading collapsed and they both fell .. . Aaos felt himself falling as into a bottomless pit-when with a start he awoke, and afterintrospection spoke to his heart:
"Verily I have fallen in love with a new belief and become moral! This I reflects itselfdifferently. What was once easy- is now difficult. All reflections are radiated matterincarnating. Who doth know what his own stillness refracts at the time of its projection?Who would suspect afterthought without consciousness? The I, to be self prophecy-without a conglomeration of old clothes-is by a deliberation previous to will-to benoumenal; is anterior to time. Forgive? [i.e. to free from consciousness]. Yea, a thousandtimes! so that the desire become large and insane enough to self-will. How can memoryforget-when we invented reaction? What is all bad memory-but morality? What is willbut reaction-impulsed from the accidents of I?"
Then Aaos remembered he had conditioned his realization by thought of time andremarked:
"So ends in the part sexuality-all asses' magic that premeditates time. Much thoughtdestroys the nerve. The arcana knows more than the I wills: and thus should I have it."
Then Aaos laughed aloud and spoke:
"Up! Up! my sexuality! and be a light unto all-that is in me!"
For he had-while contemplating-eluded his I and knew he would shortly obtain . . . Andthus he found a new use for his righteousness.
SELF-LOVE AND MAP MAKING
Aaos in his youth had many dreams, pleasing and otherwise; awake and in his sleep.Frequently, fragments of dreams haunted him for many a day, but they were of hismarriage bed. After his divorce he slept alone with his sword. Aaos, once dreamed hewas till asleep, and this was his dream:
"He had been exploring an unknown country and having returned, was busy makingmaps from his rough sketches and memoranda. He was surprised how fresh was hismemory of every questioned detail, at the ease with which his hand drew the mountainsand contours of that unknown country. His dexterity became too pleasing andthreatened an event long ceased and then forgotten."
By his determination he awoke and was able to calm the excited passion. He wasconsoled that nothing had happened. Then he spoke to himself thus:
"What new deceit is this? Must I be for ever solving the changing symbolism of thewretched morality-called 'I'? Do I still need a loin cloth for my passions? Verily, to be alone and map drawing is now an unsafe art! Sleep?-This sexual excitement still obtains.Procreation is with more things than women. The function of the sexuality is not entirelyprocreation: stranger experiences are promised than ever imagination conceived! Onemust retain-to give birth to will. Behold! my Self-love, thee I pleasure too well,-to let slipinto other being!"
AAOS AND THE UNDERTAKER
One dark night, leaving the tavern more or less sober and wandering without thought, Iarrived at a well illuminated undertaker's shop. Intoxicated, I am always curious of thework in such places-so here I paused. At that moment, the door was flung violently openand five drunken undertaker's assistants lurched into me. I objected in a mild way, theybeing numerous and I thinking that drunkards are lucky . . . But that any resistance orexcuses I might offer would be unsatisfactory was too apparent. They had reached thequarrelsome state and I discovered-I knew these men too well! From argument to foulaccusations [and what did they not call me?]-came blows-I thought it safer not to runaway. Did I fight well? I know they did and with drunken humour dragged me into theshop to purchase a coffin. Within, came recognition-Alas, too truly they knew me! Fromthen no quarter was given. That drunken fight among the dead and funeral furniturewas hopeless for me.
I was robbed, stripped, spat upon, kicked and bound-what abuse did I not suffer? I thinkthe humiliation and blows rendered me unconscious! But, I was not to rest so easily-theysoon brought me back to consciousness for worse things . . . And I was told they hadrecently finished making my wife's coffin. They then forced me to view her dead body.Even in my pitiable state, I thought of the beauty of her corpse. Again, they reviled mebecause of her: she who, if I had not neglected her, would still be living. I, thewhoremonger, betrayer of women, and arch-abnormalist. After much other insult; theytold me-my fate. I was given the choice of being burnt to death or buried alive with her!Naturally my choice was to be alone. But no such chance was to be mine. I was buriedalive with her corpse. With their combined weight forcing on the lid. I thought I was dead[for did I not hear the rushing winds?] when doubt crept into my soul. Then realizationof life dawned when I felt that cold corpse crushed against my body by the tightness ofthe coffin,-never have I realized such horror! With a mighty yell, my after suspirationburst that overcrowded coffin into fragments! I arose, thinking I was alone. But no,sitting by the corpse, amid the debris was-the devil grinning! To be alone and half alivewith the devil is not a welcome anti-climax ... Then he spoke unto me:
"Coward! where was thy courage, even against drunken enemies? Ah ah! Thou hastindeed willed pleasure! Who has the power, Thou or I? What medicine for the deadGods! Thou wretched scum of littlenesses-heal thy gaping wounds, thou art more fittedto pray than to prey."
Much more did he utter, till my very ears closed. With a body torn to pieces, crushed inevery part-what was I to answer? My silence compelled him again to speak:
"Hast thou no complaint?"
In a mighty rage-for this was a worse goad than all my earlier suffering-I answered:
"Curses, no! keep your possessions.-I will pleasure. Do your utmost! this poor thing mybody you will again replace!"
Then I fought the devil and behold,-I became alone! What happened? I, in my miserableplight, not even my teeth left-how could I have conquered the devil? Did I become asuccubus? Perhaps-I became the devil? But this I know-I did will pleasure. And from thisday shall smile in all men's faces. Then Aaos awoke and murmured:
"Belief and desire are the great duality which engender all illusions that entangle thesenses [i.e. sexuality] and prevent free will. What is all accidental suffering but reactionfrom dead loves now become diableries. How much are we sensible of body? Yet thecomposition of the body is its relationship between consciousness and all creation.Without doubt I am now an-undertaker!"
THE DEATH OF TZULA
In his sleep Aaos one day met his sister Tzula and learned she was thinking of marriageand she questioned him thus:
"My most loved brother, what is your opinion of entering marriage? I would be guided byyour experience and cunning on sexual matters. My body is weak from desire andsuffers a horrible restlessness that surprises my habits of virginity."
Aaos answered:
"What cause is there for astonishment? This life force acts and invents from itself; evenwhen the usual channels of expression are open. How much more so-when closed andthe nature non-moral? With deceivers, one may well promise and not fulfil for this end,that with a double will there shall be satisfaction without the labour of birth. Resist notdesire by repression: but tranmute desire by changing to the greater object."
Tzula answered:
"Alas! this dreadful thing of desire seeks its liberation in willing opposite to all my effortsof conciliation: Cannot marriage be my emancipation?"
Aaos answered:
"O my sister, must thou become ever smaller from thy small desires? Oh! renounce half-desiring, much better is it to marry the evil. For thee my sister, I wish no marriage butthe marriage of the greater love. For I announce, the day to come, yea it is nigh, thyabsorption in a male incarnation. What is nature but thy past will incarnated andremoved from consciousness by its further desires? The relationship still livingprovokes the involuntary purpose-thy opposition to which causes disease, and is but
resistance of the I to the Self. Bind thy desire by attention on Thy love of desire-lest itwholly runs away. Prevent thy belief from incarnating through this consciousness of theever present greater desire. Forestall the inclinations of desire by this and not by othermeans of exhausting desire. Neither abstinence nor over indulgence necessarilydestroys. Verily, my sister I would have thee a male incarnation."
Then he became sleepy his sister becoming dim and the dream more meaningless, tillhe felt something that made him start with horror-awaking he perceived someone leavehis couch! Aaos seizing his sword gnashing his teeth, trembling in every limb, and withghastly visage, shouted:
"Alpha and Omega! Thou thyself shall throttle that which thou wouldst surpass," Andswung his sword which struck horribly . . .
Then shaking the perspiration from his head he muttered to himself;
"Verily! again am I the pitiable moralist, the drowsiest of watchman. Sisters were everdeceivers! All virgins are foolish; What does their virginity matter?"
Then clasping his sword again he went to his couch and tried to rest but no sleep came,until daybreak: for he wondered who his sister was.
THE BUTCHER OF THOSE WHO FOLLOW
In a dream, Aaos one day crossed the border line and wandered into the flat countrytowards what seemed, in the half-rain, a deserted heap of ruins. Arriving closer to thecity, there issued from it a dreadful stench accompanying agonizing groans. Enteringthe gates Aaos found it a vast slaughterer's abattoir; an endless shambles of dyingbodies tied in sacks. The black mud of the streets was streaming blood, the carnalhouses bespattered-the very atmosphere pulsating agony; the grey sky reflecting itsred. Holding his nose and stopping his ears Aaos walked on . . . Then he paused and hisfrightened eyes watched the work of slaughter and he observed that every victim wasalready beheaded, but not dead, that they were sheep and being bled to death.
As he watched the mass of writhing corpses in that foul Bedlam of death groans-mademore loathsome by the ribald jesting of the slaughtermen, the scene became more vast,more heathenly impossible, when he noticed towering before him a giant shape withgory sheepskin used as loincloth, who, with a shrill voice shouted:
"Woe unto you that seek this awful place of satiety. I am the guardian namedNecrobiosis, in order that there may be mobility!"
Then seeing Aaos he laughed hideously, and addressed him thus:
"But why cometh Aaos in the close season? Thou old dodger of Time, thou eye winkingat all things! For thou canst will love in that which is most repulsive. Away O Aaos, Thoutoo art an arch-slaughterer of sheep. "

One night, Aaos dreamed he was mournfully labouring his way uphill, through anendless ruin of cities. The streets were a chaos of debris-the air heavy with the stalestench of damp charred wood and mouldeing refuse. Nowhere saw he a sign of life-Thesky was dead and breathless. Stumbling along till his body sickened. Wearily he pausedto rest and looking down, noticed the litter of a manuscript. Stooping, he chose thenearest fragment, and this was what he read:
"I too was once a mighty pleasure garden of all things that enchanted the senses;possessing men and women of every desirable form and nationality. All the hiddentreasures of nature were exhibited with art and cunning accident. No desire could beungratified. . . . What am I now? A putrid mess and dust of dead habitations. An emptywine skin destroyed and gone rotten! O, stranger, what is the cause of my desolation?"
Aaos, sitting down, mused long to himself:
"When the very ground beneath one's feet collapses, what is secure? What chance ofescape- but fore-knowledge? Would the study of grammar, or correct pronounciation oflanguage, save one?"
While he was thus meditating, suddenly he was afraid and gave a start. For beside hisshadow grew another shadow. And when he looked round, there stood before him anilluminated youth who said:
"Awake Aaos, This sorry ruin thou didst cause by thy greater love. All these pleasureswere but dreams, which awoke too violently. What is all sexuality but the infinitesynonyms of Self-love; self created and destroyed? These pleasures now dead,suppressed their own antecedent indulgence by afterthoughts of women. All originalthought, once suppressed becomes volcanic."
Aaos, winking his eye, answered:
"When asleep, one should procreate in barren soil?" at which they both smiled.
After they had surveyed each other, Aaos arose and left the youth. Surmounting aneminence he searched the sky long, until he observed the faint glow of the sun 
struggling through the mists, he spake thus:
"Abstinence from righteousness by total indiscrimination, becomes limitlessness. O Sun!like thee, I too will kiss all things and sleep alone, so that they propagate my ecstasy!"
Awaking Aaos remembered his purpose, and spoke to his heart:
"The arcana of desire [i.e. Self-love] would be satisfied with none but its original Self-bythe unique. Thus my morality taught me by dream symbols. As in life, so in sleep-allthings have a sexual significance, hidden by righteousness. Herein is a mystery and themeans to will. What is all humanity but one's own forgotten deliberation-becomingrestless? The unexpected bark of a dog should not frighten. Neither is medicine takenby pronouncing the name of the remedy. Verily, in the time of cataclysm it is too late topick the right word."

THE HEAVEN OF AAOS:
"All things are subject to resurrection" thus spake smiling Aaos, on rising from the dead.
Then turning towards his shadow . . . .
"I come! the changing word that destroys religion, a vortex wind that shall jest inTemples! Again! A reveller in the marshalled order of the sexes, the mad anarch ofdesires, the wild satyr of wolfish kisses! Once again to earth, O Thou whirlwind of desire,thou drunken breath of ribald lightning! My vampire chalice of ecstasy! Yea, as my rapacious flame reareth before thee, thou escapeth from me with the laughing whisperof thy wonderful pleasure!

THE DREAMS OF AAOS
THE I AND THE ARCANUM
One day the time drew near for the experiment and Aaos was watching the waters, tomake arcana by arbitrary projection into the utter void of his isolation. And this was hiswish-"In future my dreams shall interpretate themselves as will [i.e. reaction]."
For, he reasoned: "Why not live asleep all suffering?" Aaos had lived the preliminaryritual of habit in the cesspools and exhausted them in the mountains.

In life I have realized possibilities not contained in heaven-amidst a cowardiceinconceivable but accomplished everywhere. I have made known [opening his book]something that is different to the muck of retouched photography which men callreality: although it has been the evil habit of thousands of years. I have created art [lived belief] that surpasses all evolved conception. I have incarnated that which I-need torationalize: Verily-not the ever present portraiture of experience to satisfy the ovine: Noobvious allegory of asses-thinking God: No still-life group of empty bottles and oldmaids commonplaces: Nor the gay-tragedy of song. But stange desires of strangerarcana. The law I make while thinking God-and will smash and remake again: so that Imay commit every conceivable sin against its word. My utility has been-my pleasure-thatalone is my service to man and to heaven, in that I am the Goat."
After his devotion Aaos prepared for the Death posture and judgement. Awaking fromthe awful wrath-his teeth chattering, his limbs shivering and drenched with a coldperspiration, he allowed the ague to exhaust itself and thought thus:
"Verily, I have nothing to forgive or repent . . . Alas! what fears this I but its ownconditions? Man will create the faster moving body outside himself-always preferingcompulsion to the infinite possibilities of freedom. Alas! Alas! that which is ornamentalreacts its uselessness-the symbol 'I was.' The necroloque of love-is utility."
Then rising from his couch and taking an ecstatic inbreath:
"Again would I die violently and jest at God."
The operation having exhausted him he suffered this daydream:
"The waters became murky, then muddy, and movement began. Going nearer, heobserved-a phosphorescent morass crowded with restless abortions of humanity andcreatures-like struggling mudworms, aimless and blind: an immense swamp ofdissatisfaction; a desire smashed into pieces."
With his will, the dream changed and he became in a vast warehouse-cum-brothel.Realizing his whereabouts he muttered:
"Such is life, an endless swallowing and procreation, morally, man is a bastard."
The floor was strewn with dirty clothes and candle ends: knowing the strangest women,nothing was pleasing enough . . . so his attention wandered to the upper story. He wascertain he had been there before by a staircase. But now, there was no easy means ofaccess. He would have to climb whatever served. After much painful effort he managedto reach and hang on to the balustrade of the upper floor. There, he noticed the storecontained innumerable strange effigies and new creations of humanity. He struggledfurther along to obtain an easy means of ingress, thinking:
"Where there is desire-there shall be found the desired sleeping partner. What is true, ispleasurable Self. I have now reached the sixth letter of the alphabet."
When suddenly he observed another and more agile following him-who when reachingAaos, clutched hold of him-shouting:
"Where I cannot reach, thou too shall not ascend."
Their combined weight became too heavy-the balustrading collapsed and they both fell .. . Aaos felt himself falling as into a bottomless pit-when with a start he awoke, and afterintrospection spoke to his heart:
"Verily I have fallen in love with a new belief and become moral! This I reflects itselfdifferently. What was once easy- is now difficult. All reflections are radiated matterincarnating. Who doth know what his own stillness refracts at the time of its projection?Who would suspect afterthought without consciousness? The I, to be self prophecy-without a conglomeration of old clothes-is by a deliberation previous to will-to benoumenal; is anterior to time. Forgive? [i.e. to free from consciousness]. Yea, a thousandtimes! so that the desire become large and insane enough to self-will. How can memoryforget-when we invented reaction? What is all bad memory-but morality? What is willbut reaction-impulsed from the accidents of I?"
Then Aaos remembered he had conditioned his realization by thought of time andremarked:
"So ends in the part sexuality-all asses' magic that premeditates time. Much thoughtdestroys the nerve. The arcana knows more than the I wills: and thus should I have it."
Then Aaos laughed aloud and spoke:
"Up! Up! my sexuality! and be a light unto all-that is in me!"
For he had-while contemplating-eluded his I and knew he would shortly obtain . . . Andthus he found a new use for his righteousness.
SELF-LOVE AND MAP MAKING
Aaos in his youth had many dreams, pleasing and otherwise; awake and in his sleep.Frequently, fragments of dreams haunted him for many a day, but they were of hismarriage bed. After his divorce he slept alone with his sword. Aaos, once dreamed hewas till asleep, and this was his dream:
"He had been exploring an unknown country and having returned, was busy makingmaps from his rough sketches and memoranda. He was surprised how fresh was hismemory of every questioned detail, at the ease with which his hand drew the mountainsand contours of that unknown country. His dexterity became too pleasing andthreatened an event long ceased and then forgotten."
By his determination he awoke and was able to calm the excited passion. He wasconsoled that nothing had happened. Then he spoke to himself thus:
"What new deceit is this? Must I be for ever solving the changing symbolism of thewretched morality-called 'I'? Do I still need a loin cloth for my passions? Verily, to be alone and map drawing is now an unsafe art! Sleep?-This sexual excitement still obtains.Procreation is with more things than women. The function of the sexuality is not entirelyprocreation: stranger experiences are promised than ever imagination conceived! Onemust retain-to give birth to will. Behold! my Self-love, thee I pleasure too well,-to let slipinto other being!"
AAOS AND THE UNDERTAKER
One dark night, leaving the tavern more or less sober and wandering without thought, Iarrived at a well illuminated undertaker's shop. Intoxicated, I am always curious of thework in such places-so here I paused. At that moment, the door was flung violently openand five drunken undertaker's assistants lurched into me. I objected in a mild way, theybeing numerous and I thinking that drunkards are lucky . . . But that any resistance orexcuses I might offer would be unsatisfactory was too apparent. They had reached thequarrelsome state and I discovered-I knew these men too well! From argument to foulaccusations [and what did they not call me?]-came blows-I thought it safer not to runaway. Did I fight well? I know they did and with drunken humour dragged me into theshop to purchase a coffin. Within, came recognition-Alas, too truly they knew me! Fromthen no quarter was given. That drunken fight among the dead and funeral furniturewas hopeless for me.
I was robbed, stripped, spat upon, kicked and bound-what abuse did I not suffer? I thinkthe humiliation and blows rendered me unconscious! But, I was not to rest so easily-theysoon brought me back to consciousness for worse things . . . And I was told they hadrecently finished making my wife's coffin. They then forced me to view her dead body.Even in my pitiable state, I thought of the beauty of her corpse. Again, they reviled mebecause of her: she who, if I had not neglected her, would still be living. I, thewhoremonger, betrayer of women, and arch-abnormalist. After much other insult; theytold me-my fate. I was given the choice of being burnt to death or buried alive with her!Naturally my choice was to be alone. But no such chance was to be mine. I was buriedalive with her corpse. With their combined weight forcing on the lid. I thought I was dead[for did I not hear the rushing winds?] when doubt crept into my soul. Then realizationof life dawned when I felt that cold corpse crushed against my body by the tightness ofthe coffin,-never have I realized such horror! With a mighty yell, my after suspirationburst that overcrowded coffin into fragments! I arose, thinking I was alone. But no,sitting by the corpse, amid the debris was-the devil grinning! To be alone and half alivewith the devil is not a welcome anti-climax ... Then he spoke unto me:
"Coward! where was thy courage, even against drunken enemies? Ah ah! Thou hastindeed willed pleasure! Who has the power, Thou or I? What medicine for the deadGods! Thou wretched scum of littlenesses-heal thy gaping wounds, thou art more fittedto pray than to prey."
Much more did he utter, till my very ears closed. With a body torn to pieces, crushed inevery part-what was I to answer? My silence compelled him again to speak:
"Hast thou no complaint?"
In a mighty rage-for this was a worse goad than all my earlier suffering-I answered:
"Curses, no! keep your possessions.-I will pleasure. Do your utmost! this poor thing mybody you will again replace!"
Then I fought the devil and behold,-I became alone! What happened? I, in my miserableplight, not even my teeth left-how could I have conquered the devil? Did I become asuccubus? Perhaps-I became the devil? But this I know-I did will pleasure. And from thisday shall smile in all men's faces. Then Aaos awoke and murmured:
"Belief and desire are the great duality which engender all illusions that entangle thesenses [i.e. sexuality] and prevent free will. What is all accidental suffering but reactionfrom dead loves now become diableries. How much are we sensible of body? Yet thecomposition of the body is its relationship between consciousness and all creation.Without doubt I am now an-undertaker!"
THE DEATH OF TZULA
In his sleep Aaos one day met his sister Tzula and learned she was thinking of marriageand she questioned him thus:
"My most loved brother, what is your opinion of entering marriage? I would be guided byyour experience and cunning on sexual matters. My body is weak from desire andsuffers a horrible restlessness that surprises my habits of virginity."
Aaos answered:
"What cause is there for astonishment? This life force acts and invents from itself; evenwhen the usual channels of expression are open. How much more so-when closed andthe nature non-moral? With deceivers, one may well promise and not fulfil for this end,that with a double will there shall be satisfaction without the labour of birth. Resist notdesire by repression: but tranmute desire by changing to the greater object."
Tzula answered:
"Alas! this dreadful thing of desire seeks its liberation in willing opposite to all my effortsof conciliation: Cannot marriage be my emancipation?"
Aaos answered:
"O my sister, must thou become ever smaller from thy small desires? Oh! renounce half-desiring, much better is it to marry the evil. For thee my sister, I wish no marriage butthe marriage of the greater love. For I announce, the day to come, yea it is nigh, thyabsorption in a male incarnation. What is nature but thy past will incarnated andremoved from consciousness by its further desires? The relationship still livingprovokes the involuntary purpose-thy opposition to which causes disease, and is but
resistance of the I to the Self. Bind thy desire by attention on Thy love of desire-lest itwholly runs away. Prevent thy belief from incarnating through this consciousness of theever present greater desire. Forestall the inclinations of desire by this and not by othermeans of exhausting desire. Neither abstinence nor over indulgence necessarilydestroys. Verily, my sister I would have thee a male incarnation."
Then he became sleepy his sister becoming dim and the dream more meaningless, tillhe felt something that made him start with horror-awaking he perceived someone leavehis couch! Aaos seizing his sword gnashing his teeth, trembling in every limb, and withghastly visage, shouted:
"Alpha and Omega! Thou thyself shall throttle that which thou wouldst surpass," Andswung his sword which struck horribly . . .
Then shaking the perspiration from his head he muttered to himself;
"Verily! again am I the pitiable moralist, the drowsiest of watchman. Sisters were everdeceivers! All virgins are foolish; What does their virginity matter?"
Then clasping his sword again he went to his couch and tried to rest but no sleep came,until daybreak: for he wondered who his sister was.
THE BUTCHER OF THOSE WHO FOLLOW
In a dream, Aaos one day crossed the border line and wandered into the flat countrytowards what seemed, in the half-rain, a deserted heap of ruins. Arriving closer to thecity, there issued from it a dreadful stench accompanying agonizing groans. Enteringthe gates Aaos found it a vast slaughterer's abattoir; an endless shambles of dyingbodies tied in sacks. The black mud of the streets was streaming blood, the carnalhouses bespattered-the very atmosphere pulsating agony; the grey sky reflecting itsred. Holding his nose and stopping his ears Aaos walked on . . . Then he paused and hisfrightened eyes watched the work of slaughter and he observed that every victim wasalready beheaded, but not dead, that they were sheep and being bled to death.
As he watched the mass of writhing corpses in that foul Bedlam of death groans-mademore loathsome by the ribald jesting of the slaughtermen, the scene became more vast,more heathenly impossible, when he noticed towering before him a giant shape withgory sheepskin used as loincloth, who, with a shrill voice shouted:
"Woe unto you that seek this awful place of satiety. I am the guardian namedNecrobiosis, in order that there may be mobility!"
Then seeing Aaos he laughed hideously, and addressed him thus:
"But why cometh Aaos in the close season? Thou old dodger of Time, thou eye winkingat all things! For thou canst will love in that which is most repulsive. Away O Aaos, Thoutoo art an arch-slaughterer of sheep. "

One night, Aaos dreamed he was mournfully labouring his way uphill, through anendless ruin of cities. The streets were a chaos of debris-the air heavy with the stalestench of damp charred wood and mouldeing refuse. Nowhere saw he a sign of life-Thesky was dead and breathless. Stumbling along till his body sickened. Wearily he pausedto rest and looking down, noticed the litter of a manuscript. Stooping, he chose thenearest fragment, and this was what he read:
"I too was once a mighty pleasure garden of all things that enchanted the senses;possessing men and women of every desirable form and nationality. All the hiddentreasures of nature were exhibited with art and cunning accident. No desire could beungratified. . . . What am I now? A putrid mess and dust of dead habitations. An emptywine skin destroyed and gone rotten! O, stranger, what is the cause of my desolation?"
Aaos, sitting down, mused long to himself:
"When the very ground beneath one's feet collapses, what is secure? What chance ofescape- but fore-knowledge? Would the study of grammar, or correct pronounciation oflanguage, save one?"
While he was thus meditating, suddenly he was afraid and gave a start. For beside hisshadow grew another shadow. And when he looked round, there stood before him anilluminated youth who said:
"Awake Aaos, This sorry ruin thou didst cause by thy greater love. All these pleasureswere but dreams, which awoke too violently. What is all sexuality but the infinitesynonyms of Self-love; self created and destroyed? These pleasures now dead,suppressed their own antecedent indulgence by afterthoughts of women. All originalthought, once suppressed becomes volcanic."
Aaos, winking his eye, answered:
"When asleep, one should procreate in barren soil?" at which they both smiled.
After they had surveyed each other, Aaos arose and left the youth. Surmounting aneminence he searched the sky long, until he observed the faint glow of the sun 
struggling through the mists, he spake thus:
"Abstinence from righteousness by total indiscrimination, becomes limitlessness. O Sun!like thee, I too will kiss all things and sleep alone, so that they propagate my ecstasy!"
Awaking Aaos remembered his purpose, and spoke to his heart:
"The arcana of desire [i.e. Self-love] would be satisfied with none but its original Self-bythe unique. Thus my morality taught me by dream symbols. As in life, so in sleep-allthings have a sexual significance, hidden by righteousness. Herein is a mystery and themeans to will. What is all humanity but one's own forgotten deliberation-becomingrestless? The unexpected bark of a dog should not frighten. Neither is medicine takenby pronouncing the name of the remedy. Verily, in the time of cataclysm it is too late topick the right word."
