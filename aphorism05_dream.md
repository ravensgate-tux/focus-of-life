## APHORISM III

### 🇯🇵

THE DREAM THAT CAME TRUE
One night Aaos was pleasured with this dream:
In his early youth, he met a beautiful maiden-famous among men who knew perfection.She was everything desirous, even to her name. He became her lover, and knew her . . .to be true. But an evil voice spoke unto him and he doubted her, believing the voice-because it was of one he had made his friend. In youth-like rage he cast aside his loverand wandered into marriage of every kind, without satisfaction. Then the evil voice died.For years Aaos wandered restlessly seeking, but never finding his lost love: thinkingthey were both in Hell.
Then in his utmost weariness and despair, he thought much more deeply; and at lastrealized that the dream was the time for magic. And then he willed . . . With the newmoon his wish was materialized and again he met his first and only love. Their heartsbeing still virgin, Aaos spoke unto her:
"Out of Chaos have I awaked and found thee, O beloved. Death itself shall not part us;for by thee alone will I have children."
And they married and were ecstatic thereafter: for in their ecstasy he noticed Deathsmile.
Aaos then awoke still living their ecstasy, and breathing heavily, spake to himself thus:
"When the thing desired is again incarnated at the time of ecstasy; there can be nosatiety. ONE! we now part. All things are possible with the original belief, once againfound. The belief, simultaneous with the desire, becomes its parallel and duality ceases.When ecstasy is transcended by ecstasy, the I becomes atmospheric-there is no placefor sensuous objects to conceive differently and react. Verily, greater will has no manthan to-jest in ecstasy: retain thyself from giving forth thy seed of life."
Aaos rising from his couch-threw away his sword and exclaimed aloud:
"Now for reality!"
