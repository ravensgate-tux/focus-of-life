実現した夢
ある夜、アオスはこんな夢を見て喜びを感じた。
彼は若い頃、完璧さを知る男たちから評判の美しい乙女に出会った。彼女は、その名前までが、彼が望むすべてのものを備えていた。彼は彼女の恋人となり、彼女の真実を知った。しかし、悪の声が彼に語りかけ、彼はその声に疑いを抱いた。その声は、彼が友としていた者のものだったからだ。若気の至りで、彼は愛する女性を捨て、あらゆる種類の結婚を転々としたが、満足することはなかった。やがて悪の声が消えた。アオスは長年、失った愛を探し求めてさまよったが、見つけることはできなかった。二人は地獄にいるのだと考えた。
そして、最も疲弊し絶望した時、彼は深く考え、ついに夢が魔法の時の到来を告げていると悟った。そして彼は願った……新月の夜、彼の願いは現実となり、彼は最初の唯一の愛と再会した。二人の心はまだ純潔で、アオスは彼女に言った：
「混沌から目覚め、お前を見つけた、愛する者よ。死さえも私たちを引き離すことはできない。お前だけから子供を授かるだろう。」
彼らは結婚し、その後絶頂の喜びに浸った。その絶頂の喜びの中で、彼は死の微笑みに気づいた。
アオスは、まだ絶頂の喜びに浸ったまま目覚め、荒い息をつきながら、自分にこう語りかけた：
「欲望の対象が恍惚の時に再び現れた時、飽きは生じない。ONE！今、私たちは別れる。元の信仰が再び見出されれば、全てが可能となる。欲望と同時に生じる信仰は、その平行線となり、二元性は消える。恍惚が恍惚を超越した時、私は大気となり、感覚の対象が異なる形で概念化し反応する場所はない。確かに、より大きな意志は、エクスタシーの中で冗談を言うこと以外にない。命の種を放つことを自制せよ。」
アオスは寝台から起き上がり、剣を投げ捨て、大声で叫んだ：
「今こそ現実だ！」

THE DREAM THAT CAME TRUE
One night Aaos was pleasured with this dream:
In his early youth, he met a beautiful maiden-famous among men who knew perfection.She was everything desirous, even to her name. He became her lover, and knew her . . .to be true. But an evil voice spoke unto him and he doubted her, believing the voice-because it was of one he had made his friend. In youth-like rage he cast aside his loverand wandered into marriage of every kind, without satisfaction. Then the evil voice died.For years Aaos wandered restlessly seeking, but never finding his lost love: thinkingthey were both in Hell.
Then in his utmost weariness and despair, he thought much more deeply; and at lastrealized that the dream was the time for magic. And then he willed . . . With the newmoon his wish was materialized and again he met his first and only love. Their heartsbeing still virgin, Aaos spoke unto her:
"Out of Chaos have I awaked and found thee, O beloved. Death itself shall not part us;for by thee alone will I have children."
And they married and were ecstatic thereafter: for in their ecstasy he noticed Deathsmile.
Aaos then awoke still living their ecstasy, and breathing heavily, spake to himself thus:
"When the thing desired is again incarnated at the time of ecstasy; there can be nosatiety. ONE! we now part. All things are possible with the original belief, once againfound. The belief, simultaneous with the desire, becomes its parallel and duality ceases.When ecstasy is transcended by ecstasy, the I becomes atmospheric-there is no placefor sensuous objects to conceive differently and react. Verily, greater will has no manthan to-jest in ecstasy: retain thyself from giving forth thy seed of life."
Aaos rising from his couch-threw away his sword and exclaimed aloud:
"Now for reality!"
