"Morals of shadow, wherein the Arcana of Zos has no commandments"
ZOS SPEAKS OF IKKAH:
Leaving aside all unreal dreams, consider this world as insincere disbelief.
Lo this day salvation has come. My 'I and Self' has agreed in belief.
I would ask of thee thy suppressed self. Is it not the new thing desired? No man shallfollow me. I am not thy preservation. Thou art the way. Assuredly, thy virtue is to beequally different.
Thy complaint is the calamity: The hypocrite is always at prayer. Dost thou suffer? Thoushalt again suffer, till thine I does not fear its body. Rather seek and increase by thytemptations, it is but the way to intelligence.
Transgression is wiser than prayer: Make this thy obsession. Thank only thyself and besilent.
The coward's way is religion. There is no fear-but righteousness.
Let this be thy one excuse, I pleasured myself.
Brave laughter-not faith. Rewarded are the courageous for they shall pass!
Thine I is envious of satisfaction. Yet none devotes himself to reality.
Whoever learneth much, unlearneth all sentimental and small desires. This is the newatavism I would teach: Demand of God equality-usurp! The mighty are righteous fortheir morals are arbitrary.
Live beyond thought in courageous originality.
These hopes and fears are somnism, there is little reality. Repent not, but strive to sin inthine own way, light-heartedly: without self-reproach. One becomes the thing itself or itscreature.
Judge without mercy, all this weakness is thy self-abuse.
Experience is by contract. The great experience: Seduce thyself to pleasure.
There is only one sin-suffering.
There is only on virtue-the will to self-pleasure.
The greatest- the greatest non-morally.
The origin of morality is obedience to the earliest form of government. In youth, allthings have to obey their parents.
O, my aged IKKAH, loose this the navel cord, that my youth may pass! The mostimportant outcome of human effort is that we learn to become righteous thieves: Topossess more easily of others for self-advantage. In this incessant glorification of work,I discover a great human secret: "Do thou the work-I my pleasure." As above so below,this is never sufficiently realized.
. . . Remorse? Nay, do unto thyself all things, fearlessly.
Finality is reached when ye have learned to digest everything.
What is all man-slaughter but what ye have done unto yourself?
Only where there is necessity is ther death. Dispense with all 'means' to an end.
There is nothing higher than joyous sensation.
Eternal Self! these millions of bodies I have outworn!
Oh, sinister ecstasy. I am thy vicious self pleasure that destroyeth all things.
Distrust thy teacher, for 'divine truth' has prevented better men from wisdom. In suchrevelation there is no suggestion.
Do thy utmost unto others: But be surely what thou wilt: and keep thy belief free ofmorality.
Observe thyself by sensation: thus know the finer perturbations and vibrations.
This much shalt thou learn: To love all men, for there will be compulsion.
Serve no man, hell is democracy.
Think not the words 'I wish,' say not the words 'I will.'
Respect thy body: it will again become thy parents.
Fear nothing,-strike at the highest.
Ennui is fear: Death is failure. Go where thou fearest most.
How canst thou become great among men? . . . Cast thyself forth! Of this event, geniusis the successful effort of memory.
Break thy commandments, be lawless unto all dogma.
Revolt is the fertiliser of the new faculties.
Knowledge and all evil wars react from previous existences that are now fragmentary tothe body and operate as disembodied astrals. The more distant the creature thatgovern our functions the more unusual is our manifestation of phenomena, which arebut living their physical peculiarities by a mechanism. Retrogress to the point whereknowledge ceases, in that law becomes its own spontaneity and is freedom.
If my word has spoken unto fragments, pushed aside marriage beds, and brushed outold grave chambers; if I ever rejoiced in calumnies, if I have murdered, lied, adulterated,robbed; if like the weather I spit on all things-is it because I remember, that of my belief-there is a volition that willeth opposite?
For I love thee, O Self!
For I love thee, O mine I!
Oh! how could I fail to be agog for originality in self-love?
Never yet has procreation with another been satisfactory.
If I have wandered into marriage with anything-there has been a conspiracy ofaccidents: within and without.
And what willeth to self-pleasure- this out-breather of good taste, this conversion toungodliness?
I know thee! . . . thou heavenly necessity that compelleth chance to supersede thesexualities!
For mine I is worthy of the Self: and alone knows what is righteousness.
Verily, I tell you good and evil are one and the same.
It is but the distance thou hast reached.
Will unto self-love - the unexhausted, the procreative of ecstasy!
Where there is life there is will unto pleasure-however paradoxical the manifestation.
Where living things command they risk nothing but their own law.
This Self-love does not circumscribe nor promise but gives whatsoever is taken-spontaneously.
Thus I teach thee, will unto pleasure of all things, for they must again change thetenacity to obedience. And this new name I give unto thee, for all accusations: Notsinner, but somnambulist.
For he who premeditates, acts in his sleep.
Having overcome the difficulty of obtaining a male incarnation from parents not toovenereal, one's habitation should be wandering among men: Employment, devotion toArt: Bed, a hard surface: Clothes of camel hair: Diet, sour milk and roots of the earth. Allmorality and love of women should be ignored. To whom does not such abandonmentgive the unknown pleasure?
Again I say: 'In all things' pleasure Thyself, for occasion need not be.
